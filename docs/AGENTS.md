## Notable Findings

- crush is the successor to OpenCode, built by Charmbracelet after the original creator joined them
- clawdbot evolved into OpenClaw after going through several name changes
- qwen and qoder are both Alibaba products but serve different purposes (CLI agent vs. full IDE platform)
- droid is Factory AI's product — it topped the Terminal-Bench benchmark
